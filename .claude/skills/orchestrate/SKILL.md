# Orchestrate

Coordinate a team of parallel agents to execute a phase from the task plan. Manages task assignment, heartbeat monitoring, verification, scope enforcement, wave transition quality gates, and PRD requirement coverage tracking.

## Steps

### 1. Parse Arguments

Extract the orchestration target from `$ARGUMENTS`:

- **Phase ID** (e.g., `A`, `B`, `D`): Load tasks from `.claude/reference/phase-10-task-plan.md` for that phase
- **Plan file path** (e.g., `docs/plans/my-plan.md`): Parse tasks from the given file
- **Inline task list** (e.g., `"task1; task2; task3"`): Create tasks from semicolon-separated descriptions
- **`--dry-run`**: Parse and display tasks without spawning agents
- **`--wave N`**: Start from wave N (skip earlier waves, assumes they're complete)
- **`--max-agents N`**: Cap agent count (default: 5)
- **`--no-prd`**: Skip PRD traceability tracking (use for plans not derived from a PRD)

If no arguments, ask the user what to orchestrate.

**Check for PRD traceability**: If the plan file contains a `prd_req` column in its task tables (generated by `/prd --to-plan`), set `HAS_PRD=true` and load the PRD from `.claude/reference/PRD.md` to extract acceptance criteria. Initialize a requirement coverage map:

```
coverage = { "M1.2": "pending", "M1.3": "pending", ... }  // all prd_req IDs from the plan
```

### 2. Create Team

**IMPORTANT: TeamCreate MUST happen before TaskCreate.** Tasks created before a team exists land in the global namespace — agents cannot discover them via TaskList.

Use `TeamCreate` with a descriptive name derived from the phase:

- Phase A → team name `phase-A-foundation`
- Phase B → team name `phase-B-package-split`
- Custom plans → derive team name from the plan filename or `$ARGUMENTS`, or prompt user
- Inline tasks → `inline-<timestamp>`

Determine initial agent count from max parallelism in the first wave (capped by `--max-agents`).

Spawn agents via the `Task` tool with:

- `team_name`: The team name from above
- `subagent_type`: `general-purpose` (all agents need full tool access)
- `model`: Match the task's `agent_type` — `haiku` for haiku tasks, `sonnet` for sonnet tasks
- `name`: Convention `{model}-{role}-{N}` (e.g., `sonnet-impl-1`, `haiku-deps-2`)

**Always** spawn one `haiku-qa` agent for continuous QA watching.

Agent spawn prompt template:

```
You are {name}, a member of team "{team_name}".

Your role: Execute assigned tasks from the task ledger. For each task:
1. Acknowledge receipt immediately via SendMessage to the team lead
2. Read full task details with TaskGet — pay attention to `prd_requirement` in metadata
3. If the task has a `prd_requirement`, the task description contains a
   "Acceptance Criteria" section with Given/When/Then blocks. Use these as
   your test specifications — each Then clause becomes an assertion.
4. Choose your implementation approach:
   - **Implementation tasks** (routes, services, repositories): Follow the `/implement` pipeline
     (pre-flight → bootstrap mock → red tests → green impl → scope guard → quality commit)
   - **Config/scaffolding tasks** (types, migrations, moves): Use `/quality-commit` directly
5. If tests fail and you suspect mock wiring: describe the failure pattern in your message
   to the team lead — they can spawn a mock-debugger agent to diagnose
6. Report completion with commit hash AND a "Requirements satisfied: M1.2" line via SendMessage
7. Check TaskList for your next assignment

QA protocol: After every Edit/Write, notify haiku-qa with changed file paths.
Scope: ONLY work on your assigned task. If you discover related work, report it — do not expand scope.
```

### 3. Initialize Task Ledger

Now that the team exists, create ledger entries. For each task in the plan, use `TaskCreate` with:

- `subject`: Task title (e.g., "A-1.01 Update patch/minor runtime deps")
- `description`: Full task spec including files to modify, verification command, agent instructions,
  AND if `HAS_PRD=true`: the verbatim acceptance criteria block from the PRD for the linked requirement
- `activeForm`: Present-continuous description (e.g., "Updating runtime dependencies")
- `metadata`:
  ```json
  {
  	"agent_type": "haiku|sonnet",
  	"phase": "A",
  	"wave": "1",
  	"task_id": "A-1.01",
  	"estimated_duration": "20m",
  	"verify_command": "pnpm install && pnpm build",
  	"files": "package.json (root, api, frontend)",
  	"status_detail": "pending",
  	"prd_requirement": "M1.2"
  }
  ```
  Omit `prd_requirement` if this task has no linked PRD requirement.

Set up `blockedBy` dependencies from the task plan's **Depends** column using `TaskUpdate`.

Print a summary:

```
Phase A: Dependency Updates + Fastify Hardening
  22 tasks (6 haiku, 16 sonnet) across 3 waves
  Wave 1: 6 tasks (all haiku, all parallel)
  Wave 2: 12 tasks (1 haiku, 11 sonnet)
  Wave 3: 4 tasks (2 haiku, 2 sonnet)
  PRD requirements tracked: 8 (M: 5, S: 3)
  Estimated: ~13 hours agent work
```

### 4. Assign First Wave

Read `TaskList` to find unblocked, unassigned tasks matching the current wave.

For each idle agent:

1. Find a matching task (haiku tasks → haiku agents, sonnet tasks → sonnet agents)
2. Use `TaskUpdate` to set `owner` and `status: in_progress`
3. Update metadata: `{ "assigned_at": "<ISO timestamp>", "status_detail": "assigned" }`
4. Send task details via `SendMessage` including:
   - Task ID and title
   - Files to modify
   - Verification command
   - PRD requirement ID and acceptance criteria (if `prd_requirement` set)
   - Any dependencies or context from completed tasks

### 5. Monitor Loop

Run until all tasks in all waves are complete.

#### On Agent Message Received

**Acknowledgment** → Update metadata:

```json
{ "status_detail": "in_progress", "last_heartbeat": "<ISO timestamp>" }
```

**Completion claim** → Verify before marking done:

1. Check commit exists: Ask agent for commit hash, verify with `git log --oneline -1 <hash>`
2. Run the task's `verify_command` from metadata
3. If verified:
   - `TaskUpdate` → `status: completed`
   - If the task had a `prd_requirement` in metadata: update coverage map → `"M1.2": "completed"`
   - Print coverage delta: `✓ Requirement M1.2 satisfied by task A-2.01 (commit abc1234)`
   - Assign next unblocked task from the wave (or next wave if current is done)
4. If not verified:
   - Send specific feedback about what failed
   - Keep task `in_progress`

**Requirement satisfaction claim** → If agent says "Requirements satisfied: M1.2" in their message:

1. Cross-check: is there a completed task with `prd_requirement: "M1.2"`? If yes, trust the claim.
2. Update coverage map → `"M1.2": "completed"`
3. Log to an internal coverage ledger (in-memory, reported at wave/phase completion)

**Issue report** → Assess severity:

- Blocking: Create a fix task, assign to available agent
- Non-blocking: Log and continue
- Scope creep: Redirect agent back to assigned task

#### Stall Detection

Every 90 seconds, check in-progress tasks:

1. Read `TaskList` for tasks with `status: in_progress`
2. Check `last_heartbeat` timestamp in metadata
3. If stale (>90s with no message from the assigned agent):
   - Send a check-in message to the agent
   - If no response after another 90s: mark as stalled, reassign to a different agent
   - Update metadata: `{ "status_detail": "stalled", "reassigned_from": "<agent-name>" }`

#### Scope Enforcement

If an agent reports working on files NOT listed in their task's `files` metadata:

1. Send a stop message: "You're modifying files outside your task scope. Please revert and focus on: {task files}"
2. If repeated: Reassign the task to a different agent

#### Status Report

Print every 3 minutes (or when the user asks):

```
+------------------------------------------+
| Phase A -- Wave 2 Progress               |
+------------------------------------------+
| Completed: 6/12  | In Progress: 3       |
| Stalled: 0       | Pending: 3           |
+------------------------------------------+
| sonnet-impl-1: A-2.04 Valkey cache  [##-]|
| sonnet-impl-2: A-2.10 OracleStore   [#--]|
| haiku-deps-1:  A-2.11 knip CI       [###]|
| haiku-qa:      watching (last: PASS)     |
+------------------------------------------+
| PRD Coverage: M1.2 ✓  M1.3 ⋯  S2.1 ⋯   |
+------------------------------------------+
```

### 6. Wave Transition Gate

When all tasks in a wave are complete:

1. Run full quality gate:

   ```bash
   pnpm build && npx vitest run && pnpm lint
   ```

2. If the phase's wave has a specific **Gate** command (from the task plan), run that too
3. Print wave coverage delta:
   ```
   Wave 2 complete. Requirements satisfied this wave: M1.2, M1.3
   Requirements still pending: S2.1 (queued for Wave 3)
   ```
4. **Gate passes** → Move to next wave, assign new tasks per Step 4
5. **Gate fails** → Diagnose the failure, create a fix task, assign to an available agent

Read the wave checklist from `wave-template.md` for the full pre/during/post checklist.

### 7. Phase Completion

When all waves are complete:

1. Run the phase's final verification (from the task plan's last wave Gate)
2. Run `/health-check --quick` for a comprehensive quality check
3. Print final summary with requirements coverage:

   ```
   Phase A Complete
     Tasks: 22/22 completed
     Duration: 4h 32m
     Agents: 5 (2 sonnet, 2 haiku, 1 qa)
     Commits: 22
     Issues: 2 (1 stall reassignment, 1 scope redirect)
     Quality: All gates passed

   PRD Requirements Coverage:
     ✓ M1.1 — Auth token refresh (task A-1.02)
     ✓ M1.2 — Rate limiting per org (task A-2.04)
     ✓ M1.3 — Audit log blockchain (task A-3.01)
     ✓ S2.1 — Cache invalidation (task A-2.10)
     ✗ S2.2 — SKIPPED (out of scope for this phase)
   ```

4. **Auto-update PRD** (if `HAS_PRD=true` and coverage map has changes):
   - Call `/prd --update` with context: "Phase A complete. Mark these requirements as implemented:
     M1.1, M1.2, M1.3, S2.1. Update their status to [IMPLEMENTED] with implementation date and
     the commit range <first>..<last>."
   - This keeps the PRD as living truth — it converges toward complete as phases execute.

5. Shut down all agents via `SendMessage` with `type: shutdown_request`
6. Clean up team via `TeamDelete`

### 8. Cross-Phase Handoff

If more phases are queued (following the Phase Dependency DAG):

1. Check which phases are now unblocked (e.g., after A completes → B, D, F are unblocked)
2. For parallel phases, set up git worktrees per the Git Worktree Parallelization Strategy:

   ```bash
   git worktree add ../portal-phase-{X} phase-10/{X}-{name}
   cd ../portal-phase-{X} && pnpm install
   ```

3. Start a new orchestration cycle for each unblocked phase
4. Report to user which phases are starting in parallel

## Arguments

- `$ARGUMENTS`: Phase ID, plan file path, or inline task list. Optional flags:
  - `--dry-run`: Parse and display tasks without spawning agents
  - `--wave N`: Start from wave N (skip earlier completed waves)
  - `--max-agents N`: Cap concurrent agent count (default: 5)
  - `--no-qa`: Skip spawning a dedicated QA watcher (not recommended)
  - `--no-prd`: Skip PRD traceability (for plans not derived from a PRD)
  - `--verbose`: Print all agent messages to the user (noisy but useful for debugging)

## Integration Points

### Skill Pipeline

```
/prd                    → .claude/reference/PRD.md  (living requirements)
  └─ /prd --to-plan     → docs/plans/<feature>-plan.md  (task table with prd_req column)
       └─ /orchestrate  → spawns team, assigns tasks with Given/When/Then context
            └─ agents: /implement  (tests written against PRD acceptance criteria)
            └─ on complete: coverage map updated, /prd --update called at phase end
```

### Referenced Skills

- **`/implement`** — Agents use this for implementation tasks (combines pre-flight + TDD + scope guard + quality commit). When the task carries a `prd_requirement`, agents write tests from the PRD's Given/When/Then acceptance criteria blocks.
- **`/quality-commit`** — Fallback for tasks that don't need the full `/implement` pipeline (config changes, docs, simple moves)
- **`/review-all`** — Run at phase completion for comprehensive multi-agent review (security + Oracle + API audit + scope)
- **`/health-check`** — Run at phase completion for comprehensive quality gate validation
- **`/prd --update`** — Called automatically at phase completion to mark satisfied requirements as [IMPLEMENTED]

### Referenced Protocols

- **QA Watcher Protocol** — `.claude/reference/phase-10-task-plan.md` section "Continuous QA Watcher Protocol"
- **Git Worktree Strategy** — `.claude/reference/phase-10-task-plan.md` section "Git Worktree Parallelization Strategy"
- **Phase Dependency DAG** — A→B→C, A→D, A→F, B→E (from task plan header)

### Claude Code Native Tools Used

- `TeamCreate` / `TeamDelete` — Team lifecycle (**must happen before TaskCreate**)
- `TaskCreate` / `TaskUpdate` / `TaskList` / `TaskGet` — Ledger operations (scoped to team namespace)
- `SendMessage` — Agent communication (DM, broadcast, shutdown)
- `Task` tool — Spawning agents with `team_name` parameter

## Examples

- `/orchestrate A` — Run Phase A (Dependency Updates + Fastify Hardening)
- `/orchestrate A --dry-run` — Preview Phase A tasks without spawning agents
- `/orchestrate A --wave 2` — Resume Phase A from Wave 2
- `/orchestrate A --max-agents 3` — Run Phase A with at most 3 concurrent agents
- `/orchestrate docs/plans/custom-plan.md` — Orchestrate from a custom plan file (auto-detects PRD traceability)
- `/orchestrate "add auth middleware; write auth tests; update docs"` — Inline tasks (no PRD)
- `/orchestrate docs/plans/search-plan.md --no-prd` — Run plan without PRD feedback loop

## Error Recovery

- **Agent crashes**: Detect via stall timeout, reassign task to new agent
- **Quality gate fails**: Create fix task, assign to available agent, re-run gate
- **All agents stalled**: Report to user, suggest manual intervention or restart
- **Git conflicts**: If worktree merge fails, pause and ask user for resolution strategy
- **PRD update fails**: Log the coverage map to `docs/plans/<feature>-coverage.md` as fallback — the user can run `/prd --update` manually with the logged requirement IDs

## Common Mistakes (Anti-Patterns)

- **DO NOT call TaskCreate before TeamCreate** — tasks created in the global namespace are invisible to team agents via TaskList
- **DO NOT use `git add -A` in agent prompts** — always stage specific files
- **DO NOT send requirement coverage claims without a verified commit** — a test passing locally ≠ a committed, green build
